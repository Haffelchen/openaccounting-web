# Open Accounting Web Interface

This is the front-end web interface for Open Accounting. It communicates with the [server](https://github.com/openaccounting/oa-server) over a [REST API](https://openaccounting.io/api).

## Dev Environment

This software is built with Angular. To get started, make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed.


Then follow these steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/openaccounting/oa-web.git`
2. `cd oa-web`
3. `npm install`


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Choose API server

Click on the Settings link and specify the URL for your [server](https://github.com/openaccounting/oa-server). Or you can use https://api.openaccounting.io if you want Open Accounting to host your information.
